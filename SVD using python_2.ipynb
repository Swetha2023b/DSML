Numpy also provides many functions to create arrays with all zero values, all  ones, identity matrix, all random values.\n","\n","Vectorization is used to speed up the Python code without using loop. Using such a function can help in minimizing the running time of code efficiently. Various operations are being performed over vector such as dot product of vectors which is also known as scalar product as it produces single output, outer products which results in square matrix of dimension equal to length X length of the vectors, Element wise multiplication which products the element of same indexes and dimension of the matrix remain unchanged.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2ikaV9dlV5tG","outputId":"86b9ac0c-45da-4320-b336-26dad9a12109","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661158171153,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Swetha Prakash","userId":"12192433779507053703"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","a = np.array([1, 2, 3])   # Create a rank 1 array\n","print(\"type: %s\" %type(a))            # Prints \"<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\"\n","print(\"shape: %s\" %a.shape)            # Prints \"(3,)\"\n","print(a[0], a[1], a[2])   # Prints \"1 2 3\"\n","a[0] = 5                  # Change an element of the array\n","print(a)                  # Prints \"[5, 2, 3]\"\n","\n","b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])    # Create a rank 2 array\n","print(\"\\n shape of b:\",b.shape)                     # Prints \"(2, 3)\"\n","print(b[0, 0], b[0, 1], b[1, 0])   # Prints \"1 2 4\"\n","\n","a = np.zeros((2,2))   # Create an array of all zeros\n","print(\"All zeros matrix:\\n  %s\" %a)              # Prints \"[[ 0.  0.]\n","                      #          [ 0.  0.]]\"\n","\n","b = np.ones((1,2))    # Create an array of all ones\n","print(\"\\nAll ones matrix:\\n  %s\" %b)              # Prints \"[[ 1.  1.]]\"\n","\n","d = np.eye(2)         # Create a 2x2 identity matrix\n","print(\"\\n identity matrix: \\n%s\"%d)              # Prints \"[[ 1.  0.]\n","                      #          [ 0.  1.]]\"\n","\n","e = np.random.random((2,2))  # Create an array filled with random values\n","print(\"\\n random matrix: \\n%s\"%e)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n","shape: 3\n","1 2 3\n","[5 2 3]\n","\n"," shape of b: (2, 3)\n","1 2 4\n","All zeros matrix:\n","  [[0. 0.]\n"," [0. 0.]]\n","\n","All ones matrix:\n","  [[1. 1.]]\n","\n"," identity matrix: \n","[[1. 0.]\n"," [0. 1.]]\n","\n"," random matrix: \n","[[0.72204214 0.70787884]\n"," [0.45136417 0.21312674]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","a = np.array([1, 2, 3])   # Create a rank 1 array\n","print(\"type: %s\" %type(a))\n","print(\"shape: %s\" %a.shape)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"h9YyGpbowQo0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661158500303,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Swetha Prakash","userId":"12192433779507053703"}},"outputId":"553a4afd-95e0-43d2-c638-b61293b6030c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n","shape: 3\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mw5OfpWFpWdh"},"source":["in the observation book, it starts from here only."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hluFpHNFpb2s","outputId":"5bb35d5c-8b43-4a39-a654-d349206907f3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1661160054162,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Swetha Prakash","userId":"12192433779507053703"}}},"source":["#vectorized sum\n","print(\"Vectorized sum example\\n\")\n","x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\n","print(\"x:\\n %s\" %x)\n","print(\"sum: %s\"%np.sum(x))  # Compute sum of all elements;
